# University project
This academic project, developed without using NumPy, revolves around matrices and involves the implementation and comparison of various methods, including Jacobi, Gauss-Seidl, and LU factorization. The focus lies in creating a matrix structure from scratch and conducting a thorough comparison of these numerical methods.
